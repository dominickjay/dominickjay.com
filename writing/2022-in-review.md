This year has been crazy busy, both on a Personal and Professional Level - starting a new role, bringing with it a whole wealth of new challenges, and increasing my personal skills outside of my professional career As the year closes out, I thought I would take a bit of time to review how the year has gone publicly, rather than the normal ‘well that year went ok’ type introspection that normally happens.

## I started a new role

The first big thing that happened this year was leaving my previous role at RoweIT for pastures new at Series Eight. For me, this was a huge decision and one that has paid off time and time again.

- working remotely
- Working in front end again

### I started working with a bunch of new tech

- shopify
- Craft
- Tailwind
- AlpineJS

### Dev Community game was weak

- Wasn’t too active on discord/LinkedIn
- Didn’t blog as much

### I went to Portugal

- first time meeting a lot of new colleagues
- Make this Last to tie into personal section

### I bought a house
