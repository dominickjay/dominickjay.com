## Introduction

In this post, we are going to look into React components, what they are, what types are available and how we can create them. We'll then quickly scale up a project using the CRA, and put together a custom component to see how it all clicks together.

## What is it?

So, what is a component?

_Components are independent pieces of functionality that you can reuse in your application, and are the building blocks of all React applications. Often, they can be simple JavaScript functions and classes, but you use them as if they were customized HTML elements. Buttons, menus, and any other front-end page content can all be created as components. Components can also contain state information and display markdown._
