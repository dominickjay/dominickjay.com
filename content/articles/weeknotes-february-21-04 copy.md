### Professional

1. My codepen from last week was picked by the team and has had a slowly growing number of views and likes over the last week, so super happy about that. Currently on 74 'loves' and 2,780 views. [Here it is](https://codepen.io/dominickjay217/pen/BamOBRZ).
1. Added in a dark/light mode toggle to this site (See at the top of the page, above the navigation) as found `prefers-color-scheme` wasn't working on Firefox.
1. Refactored a *whole* bunch of custom property names after a short discussion on the Front End Horse discord about naming conventions.

1. As of Friday 11:19AM, I have walked 32,846 steps according to Apple Health.
1. Started up bodyweight/cardio exercises, replacing my purely free-weight workouts, and feel much better for it.
1. Went to Paignton Zoo for my niece's birthday. It's somewhere we have visited at least once a year since my eldest was born and it's always a good day out.
