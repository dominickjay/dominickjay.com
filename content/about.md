Hi ðŸ‘‹. My nameâ€™s Dom and I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Rowe IT. In the past, I have worked at GOSS Interactive, n9 Design and Logo CCP, and graduated from Bournemouth University with a BSc in Computing.

Over my time in design agencies and private sector work, I have gathered a knowledge for all round user experience, whilst incorporating accessibility and creativity as a standard in my work. You can see a more indepth account of my work history on my <a href="/docs/resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resume</a>. My current role at [Rowe IT](https://roweit.co.uk) as a Software Engineer allows me to work on a wide range of technologies and processes.

I make consistent updates to this site; both with the visuals and with the content. I treat this site as a playground to try out things I have learnt or want to get using. I am constantly writing in my blog <a href="/articles">here</a>, or putting together small projects on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/dominickjay217/).
