intro: 'Creative Front End Developer, writer, music nerd.'
text: "<strong class='fl-text-step-1'>Hi ðŸ‘‹. My name's Dom and I'm a Front-end Developer currently working at Series Eight. In the past, I have worked at Rowe IT, GOSS Interactive, n9 Design and Logo CCP, and graduated from Bournemouth University with a BSc in Computing.</strong>
<br /><br />Over my time in design agencies and private sector work, I have gathered a knowledge for all round user experience, whilst incorporating accessibility and creativity as a standard in my work. You can see a more indepth account of my work history on my resume. My current role at Series Eight as a Front-end Developer allows me to work on a wide range of technologies and processes.

I make consistent updates to this site; both with the visuals and with the content. I treat this site as a playground to try out things I have learnt or want to get using. I am constantly writing in my blog here, or putting together small projects on CodePen.<br /><br />

You can also see what I am currently up to now."
