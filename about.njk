text: "Over my time in design agencies and private sector work, I have gathered a knowledge for all round user experience, whilst incorporating accessibility and creativity as a standard in my work. You can see a more indepth account of my work history on my <a href='/docs/resume.pdf' target='_blank'>resume</a>. My current role at <span class='highlight'>Series Eight</span> as a <span class='highlight'>Front-End Developer</span> allows me to work on a wide range of technologies and processes.

I make consistent updates to this site; both with the visuals and with the content. I treat this site as a playground to try out things I have learnt or want to get using. I am constantly writing in my blog here, or putting together small projects on <a href='https://codepen.io/dominickjay217' target='_blank'>CodePen</a>."
