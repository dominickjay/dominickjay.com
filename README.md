## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/` (with remote DB) |
| `npm run build:local`     | Build your production site to `./dist/` (local DB) |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 🚀 Deployment to Netlify

This project is configured for deployment to Netlify with direct Turso database integration. The API endpoints connect directly to your Turso database.

### Required Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Netlify dashboard:

- `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`: Your Turso database URL (e.g., `libsql://joke-counter-[your-org].turso.io`)
- `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Turso authentication token

### Database Configuration

The project uses direct Turso connection with a `ClickCounter` table for tracking user interactions. The API endpoints (`/api/click-counter`) connect directly to your Turso database.

### Database Schema

Make sure your Turso database has the following table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ClickCounter (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  buttonName TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  clickCount INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  lastClicked TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

### Build Process

- **Local Development**: Uses local environment variables for Turso connection
- **Production Build**: Uses remote Turso database via environment variables
- **Netlify Deploy**: Connects directly to Turso database
