## The Fragile
- Coming into rock in a big way in 2003, started with NIN March of the Pigs
- NIN one of my go-to top tier bands

## Hail to the Thief
- Radiohead hard to choose from, could I choose Kid Amnesiac double instead?
- There There is 100+

## Songs for the Deaf
- Times of playing in a band
- Incredible concept album

## Iowa
- Brutal

## Low Teens
- Fred born, car crash and post depression
- ETID was a game changer for me

## Eternal Blue
- Found during pandemic 2020
- Still find every new single is replayable

## Lateralus
- Might be the best album I've ever heard, lyrically, conceptually and musically
- Proud that I used to be able to play it through on guitar
