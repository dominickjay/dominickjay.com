---

For each of the prominent speakers/talks, provide a concise summary of the **key takeaway(s)** and why it's important for front-end developers, focusing on actionable insights or shifts in perspective.

- **Léonie Watson - "There Is No Spoon":** "Léonie's deep dive into generative AI wasn't just theoretical; it was a powerful reminder for front-end developers about **building AI experiences accessibly from the ground up**. Her talk highlighted that our role is crucial in ensuring these new technologies truly work for *everyone*, not just a subset of users. A must-revisit if you caught it!"
- **Rachel-Lee Nabors - "Death of the Browser":** "Rachel-Lee truly challenged our perception of where and how our front-end code will live. Her insights into the potential 'death of the browser' as we know it pushed me to think about **future-proofing our skills beyond traditional web views**. This session was a fantastic prompt for proactive learning."
- **Ana Rodrigues - "Maintaining and Modernising Legacy CSS":** "Ana delivered a masterclass in taming the CSS beast. Her practical strategies for **incrementally modernizing legacy stylesheets** were invaluable. I'm leaving with concrete ideas on how to tackle those daunting CSS files and improve maintainability in existing projects – something every front-end dev faces."
- **Jack Franklin - "Debugging Web Performance":** "Jack's session was a goldmine for anyone serious about site speed. He didn't just tell us *why* performance matters, but **how to systematically diagnose and fix common bottlenecks**. His practical debugging techniques are going straight into my toolkit for ensuring our web apps are snappy and responsive."
- **Hidde de Vries - "ARIA, the Good Parts":** "Hidde's talk was a breath of fresh air, cutting through ARIA complexity to highlight the **most impactful and correctly implemented ARIA attributes**. As front-end advocates for accessibility, this session reinforced the importance of precise ARIA usage to build truly inclusive user interfaces, avoiding common pitfalls."
- **Geri Reid and Ashley Watson-Nolan - Accessibility in JET's Global Design System:** "Hearing Geri and Ashley share how they bake accessibility into a large-scale design system at JET was incredibly insightful. Their talk provided a fantastic blueprint for **integrating accessibility early and consistently within component libraries**, a critical lesson for any team building or maintaining a design system."
- **Salma Alam-Naylor - Introduction to the World Wide Web for Very Senior Programmers:** "Salma's ability to simplify complex web concepts for experienced, non-front-end developers was brilliant. Her session offered me new ways to **articulate the 'why' behind modern front-end practices** to backend colleagues, fostering better cross-team understanding and collaboration."
- **Rachel Ilan Simpson:** "Rachel's talk, as always, provided a thought-provoking perspective. [If you know her topic, add a specific insight. If not, keep it general but positive]: Her insights consistently push the boundaries of how we think about [a relevant aspect like user experience, product development, or ethical tech], offering a fresh lens for front-end implementation."
- **Thomas Beverley - Browser Choice Alliance Lightning Talk:** "Thomas's lightning talk on the Browser Choice Alliance was a sharp reminder of the ongoing importance of **browser diversity and user agency**. For front-end developers, understanding these underlying movements impacts how we consider cross-browser compatibility and the future of web standards."
