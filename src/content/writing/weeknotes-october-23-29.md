### Personal

The kids were on a school holiday this week, so took the week off work to cover that and spend some much needed time with them. Was non-stop! My daughter loves baking, and I've suddenly found that I want to try some recipes, so this was a perfect chance. The end result was actually pretty good! We went swimming at the local pool too, which has been great as their progress from their swimming lessons are really paying off - no longer stood in the pool holding onto one of them at a time. Lastly, we went to the library as we're trying to encourage them to read more outside of their school books.
