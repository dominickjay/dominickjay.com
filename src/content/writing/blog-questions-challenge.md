## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

## What’s your favourite post on your blog?
