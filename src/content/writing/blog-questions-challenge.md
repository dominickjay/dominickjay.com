## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I had been back and forth about starting writing during the 2020 lockdown. After having several discarded attempts at a portfolio - which no actual demonstratable work at that point - and having seen the benefits of sharing knowledge, I decided to pivot and move to a more 'blog' focused site instead. My first piece I wrote - outside of any 'This is what I did this week' type posts - was particuarly memorable to me personally, as it was written entirely while I had COVID-19 and was isolating away from my partner and our two kids for two weeks. I've took a few breaks here and there, but there's always a backlog of things I can write about. Life just gets in the way sometimes!

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?

The majority of my writing is done on this website, which is an 11ty site. I've not written anything on any other platforms as of yet, outside of a few that were done through my jobs at Series Eight and Rowe.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?
I mainly dump things into a Notion file, or straight into a `.md` file in VSCode and go from there. I'd like a bit more of a better setup though, so open to any recommendations!

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?
Absolutely not, I'll sit and wait to publish it until I start to get bored of it and consider dumping it. My most recent post sat in my folder unpublished for almost a month as I kept trying to expand on it rather than just keep it neat.
