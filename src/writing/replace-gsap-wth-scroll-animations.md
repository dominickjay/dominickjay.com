I was interested in picking up some new CSS tricks, and there‚Äôs been a lot of talk recently about scroll driven animations. Feeling inspired during a weekend away, I dug around on Codepen for some and came across this pen from [Ryan Mulligan](https://ryanmulligan.dev/) (hexagoncircle).

After playing around with it and digging into the source code, pretty instantly found out it was a GSAP demo rather than scroll driven animations. Ah well, it's still lovely, and this post is in **no** way assuming that I can do one better. But then I wondered how tricky it would be to take this original demo and refactor it to not depend on the GSAP library anymore, and instead bring in those sweet scroll driven animations that I was so keen to figure out.

## The original

Let's start by breaking down Ryan's demo a bit. There‚Äôs very little functional magic actually in the HTML - although it's very pretty markup! We've got a header element containing options; dark mode & some underlining styles (background, underlined etc). The bulk of the content is in a main element, as expected, with some content wrapped in a mark element with a class of text-highlight. Easy stuff, apart from‚Ä¶what‚Äôs a mark element and what‚Äôs the point of it semantically?

> The¬†**`<mark>`**¬†[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)¬†element represents text which is¬†**marked**¬†or¬†**highlighted**¬†for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.

So, to rip a use case out of the mdn docs;

**‚ÄúWhen used in a quotation (`[<q>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q)`) or block quote (`[<blockquote>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote)`), it generally indicates text which is of special interest but is not marked in the original source material, or material which needs special scrutiny even though the original author didn't think it was of particular importance. Think of this like using a highlighter pen in a book to mark passages that you find of interest.‚Äù**

Pretty interesting, that‚Äôs one for the next project if needs be then.

</div>

Outside of the setup, the real meat of the demo comes from the styles for the various animations on scroll. For the purpose of keeping this focused, those styles increase the size of a background color across the element, that being setup as a pseudo-underline rather than using ‚Äòtext-decoration: underline‚Äô. The dropdown values are used as part of an attribute on the `body` element, which allows us to style it like this;

```css
:root {
  --bg-color-highlight: hsl(60, 90%, 50%);
}

.dark-mode {
  --bg-color-highlight: hsl(238, 70%, 40%);
}

[data-highlight="background"] & {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    var(--bg-color-highlight),
    var(--bg-color-highlight)
  );
}

[data-highlight="half"] & {
  --line-size: 0.5em;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    transparent calc(100% - var(--line-size)),
    var(--bg-color-highlight) var(--line-size)
  );
}

[data-highlight="underline"] & {
  --line-size: 0.15em;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    transparent calc(100% - var(--line-size)),
    var(--color-text) var(--line-size)
  );
}
```

On the Javascript side, we've got the event listeners for the dropdown change and the dark-mode. Excluding them, we‚Äôre left with this chunk of GSAP.

```jsx
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

gsap.utils.toArray(".text-highlight").forEach((highlight) => {
  ScrollTrigger.create({
    trigger: highlight,
    start: "-100px center",
    onEnter: () => highlight.classList.add("active")
  });
});
```

To my understanding, this block does this;

- Registers the [GSAP ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/) plugin
- Uses GSAP's `toArray` function, to create an array of elements that has the `text-highlight` class on them
- On each item in the array, a `ScrollTrigger` that;
  - Uses the element as the trigger here, so each element will have its animation triggered independently from each other.
  - Starts the animation when it‚Äôs -100px from the center of the viewport.
  - Has a callback function `onEnter` that adds an active class to that specific element.

So effectively, you scroll and as each mark element gets *just* ü§è beyond the center of the viewport, the active class gets applied and BAM that sweet animation goes off. Nice! This is a real cool demo and looks ace. So let‚Äôs rip it down and rebuild it.

## The rework

The most notable thing here is that by using CSS scroll driven animations you can ditch a whole bunch of JS. That GSAP library? Out the window, saving KBs in the process. Let‚Äôs keep the dark mode/css options though in our rebuild.

```js
const highlight = document.getElementById("highlight-style");
const mode = document.getElementById("mode");

const setHighlightStyle = (value) =>
  document.body.setAttribute("data-highlight", value);

mode.addEventListener("click", (e) =>
  document.body.classList.toggle("dark-mode")
);

highlight.addEventListener("change", (e) => setHighlightStyle(e.target.value));

setHighlightStyle(highlight.value);

```

For the HTML nothing needs to change here for this, which is great. Thanks Ryan!

The CSS - given how we‚Äôre relying on it more now without the Javascript providing the animations - needs some tweaking. To the `mark` element that has the `text-highlight` class, we can add this:

```css
@keyframes highlight {
  to {
    color: var(--color-text-highlight);
    background-size: 100% 100%;
  }
}

@supports (animation-range: cover) {
  .text-highlight {
    animation: highlight linear both;
    animation-timeline: --highlight;
    view-timeline-name: --highlight;
  }
}
```

and remove this, as we're no longer adding an `active` class to any elements:

```css
  &.active {
    color: var(--color-text-highlight);
    background-size: 100% 100%;
  }
```

90% of the way there I reckon. Let's take a quick break to explain some of the new CSS properties used above.

We know about the widely used `animation` property, calling our `highlight` keyframe animation and setting it with `linear` easing and `both` for the fill-mode in order to use the animation properties both forwards and backwards through the keyframe timeline. `animation-timeline` is a new one though, with it being set to specify the timeline being used to control a CSS animation's progress. There's a few different options we can pass in - I would personally refer to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline#syntax) for this one. Maybe I'll dig a bit further into it in a future post. But for the sake of this one, we're using a single animation named timeline which is set as the name of your timeline animation (as I found, it doesn't need to necessarily need to be the name of your keyframe animation), and that name prefixed with a `--`. `view-timeline-name` is another new one, and is used to define the block in which a timeline passes across. I've seen this applied to the parent of an element with a scroll animation on, but in this case we're defining it and `animation-timeline` on the same `text-highlight` class. Again, maybe a deep dive on this one in future, as it was one of the harder parts to comprehend as I wrote this.

<div class="pull-quote pull-quote--left">

</div>

So anyway, where were we, so by setting this up this way, this starts the underlining/highlighting animation the moment the element comes into view, which isn‚Äôt exactly what we want here. Instead, we need it to trigger -100px from the center or, *at the very least,* the center itself. Scanning the docs it looks like this we could do this - `animation-range: entry 0% entry 100%;` - but that seems like it starts it way too soon.

`animation-range` works in a similar way to how `ScrollTrigger` has a `start` property (also, `end`). Simply put, you can use a single value e.g. `cover`, `contain` or two values (either timeline range value or start/end values) e.g. `25% 50%`, and is used to set where the timeline will start and end.

A great tool to work with for finding out the correct values here is [https://scroll-driven-animations.style](https://scroll-driven-animations.style/tools/view-timeline/ranges/#range-start-name=cover&range-start-percentage=0&range-end-name=cover&range-end-percentage=50&view-timeline-axis=block&view-timeline-inset=0&subject-size=smaller&subject-animation=none&interactivity=clicktodrag&show-areas=yes&show-fromto=yes&show-labels=yes), a super helpful visualizer for this. Tinkering around with it, we can change `animation-range: entry 0% entry 100%;` to `animation-range: cover 0% cover 60%`, so the highlighting effect starts when it appears in the bottom of the viewport, and finishes when it's 60% of the way up the screen.

{% imagePlaceholder "./src/assets/images/posts/replace-gsap-view-timeline-screenshot.png", "A screenshot from scroll-driven-animations.style showing support the setup for a timeline range", "Timeline range for a scroll driven animation", "(min-width: 30em) 25vw, 25vw" %}

Bingo. That seemed to do the trick pretty well, check out our final demo below. Again, this was very much written while I was learning, so if there's anything that could be done differently, please let me know!
