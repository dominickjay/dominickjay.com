We got round to catching up on a few movies that have been out for a while now. I think it's safe to say that neither where at the top of our lists to watch, and they'll probably stay that way when looking for something to watch again. I think my review of both - don't come after me - is 3/5 ðŸ¤· for both.

### Music

{% set results = musicDateFrom | apiCall(musicDateTo) %}
{% if results.length > 8 %}
  {% set layout = 'flex' %}
{% else %}
  {% set layout = 'grid' %}
{% endif %}

<div class="music-grid" style="--layout: {{ layout }}">
  {% for album in results %}
    <a href="{{ album.url }}"><img height="174" width="174" src="{{ album.art }}" loading="lazy" /></a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
